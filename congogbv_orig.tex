\section*{Introduction}\label{introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}

Over the past decades, tremendous progress has been made worldwide to
improve the lives of the world's poor. The proportion of people living
under the poverty line of \$1.25 per day dropped from over half to just
14\%; gender disparity in primary education has been drastically reduced
or even eliminated; under-five mortality rates have been halved (United
Nations 2015). However, such progress has largely bypassed fragile
states, like the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) (Asadullah and
Savoia 2018; Samy and Carment 2011). Congolese women in particular face
economic hardships and human rights violations, including a high rate of
Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV): estimates of the proportion of
women who have suffered from this range from 15\% to 40\% (Johnson et
al. 2010; Peterman, Palermo, and Bredenkamp 2011). Aid workers have
called the country ``the world's worst place to be a woman or a child'',
and the UN's Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict,
Margot Wallstr√∂m, even called the country the ``rape capital of the
world'' (Human Rights Watch 2009). The issue of SGBV is of specific
concern, given its high psychological, social and economic costs (Post
et al. 2002; Peterson et al. 2018). Consequently, tremendous
international efforts have been made to implement or support projects to
assist the victims of SGBV. The 2018 Nobel Peace prize was awarded to
Dr.~Denis Mukwege, for his work on victims of SGBV at Bukavu's Panzi
Hospital.

Despite this attention, very little reliable data exists on the topic
(Palermo and Peterman 2011). Data collection efforts have been hampered
by the conflicts the country has faced, which have made large-scale data
collection from representative samples difficult. As a result, most data
available on the topic is from surveys within clinics and NGOs aimed at
assisting victims of SGBV, making comparison between victims of SGBV and
non-victims difficult. These samples are obviously skewed, as they only
survey women who have already come forward in search for help. Even when
survey data is available, the sensitive nature of the topic may cause
respondents to withhold information due their unease in discussing
sensitive topics with survey field staff.

In this paper, I explore the characteristics of victims of SGBV as well
as non-victims to study the dynamics and potential drivers of SGBV. I
classify female survey respondents according to potential risk factors
for SGBV, and analyse whether these factors are in fact associated with
the incidence of SGBV. In this way, this paper aims to address the
question what the drivers of SGBV in Eastern Congo are. Specifically, I
consider conflict and the position of women in Congolese society as
potential drivers, and compare their relative contribution.

The conflict that has persisted in the country for the past decades is
the most often-cited driver of the high rate of SGBV. This is
particularly true for policy circles, where the framing of SGBV in Congo
as ``weapon of war'' is popular (Baaz Eriksson and Stern 2013; Kirby
2015). There is empirical evidence to support this notion. (Johnson et
al. 2010) carried out a large-scale survey in Eastern Congo to
investigate incidence and perpetrators of SGBV, and found that the
majority of sexual violence reported by their respondents was
conflict-related; of female victims of sexual violence, 74.3\% reported
the perpetrators to be conflict-related. Likewise, Bartels et al. (2013)
find that the majority of the victims of SGBV treated at Panzi Hospital
-- in Bukavu, South Kivu -- indicate that the perpetrators were armed
groups. It is therefore not surprising that the topic of SGBV in Congo
has often been analysed within the context of violent conflict (Baaz
Eriksson and Stern 2013). Conversely, the aspect of the conflict that
has received the most world-wide media attention has been SGBV
(Autesserre 2012).

However, this view of the central role of conflict in sexual violence in
the DRC has come under increasing scrutiny. It has been argued that this
focus on the relationship between sexual violence and conflict has been
counter-productive, as it has distracted attention from other pressing
problems the DRC faces (Autesserre 2012; Hilhorst and Douma 2018; Porter
2019). Moreover, it risks missing the civilian perpetrators of SGBV.
There is empirical evidence for this position too. Based on DHS data,
(Peterman, Palermo, and Bredenkamp 2011) find that rates of Sexual
Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) are higher than rates of other forms of
Sexual Violence in Congo.

This increased focus on IPV, rather than conflict, shifts attention from
conflict to the bargaining position of women in Congolese society and
households as a driver of SGBV. The bargaining position of a woman is
the level of autonomy she has, and is determined by things such as her
outside options; its effect on SGBV is ambiguous (Eswaran and Malhotra
2011). One the one hand, a woman's welfare may depend on her bargaining
position: women with more income, and better prospects in case of a
divorce would thus face less risk of IPV. On the other hand a woman's
partner may use IPV as an instrument to assert power as a response to
her increased empowerment. The empirical record reflects this ambiguity.
(Bhattacharya, Bedi, and Chhachhi 2009) find that increase in
employment, and the increasing of status of a woman within the household
reduces violence. Similarly, (Hidrobo, Peterman, and Heise 2016) find
that cash transfers to women, decrease the risk of violence. However,
when specifically looking at sexual IPV in the Dominican Republic,
(Bueno and Henderson 2017) find that an increase in women's (economic)
empowerment led to an increase in IPV. In Vietnam, (Bulte and Lensink
2019) find that a project aiming to increase women's income, may have
led to increased IPV. In Afghanistan, (Gibbs et al. 2020) find no link
(positive or negative) between economic empowerment and IPV. The link
between IPV and women's intra-household bargaining position may be
moderated by local customs, and depend on exactly the type of IPV and
the type of empowerment under consideration.

These two main drivers of SGBV -- conflict and empowerment -- are not
necessarily separate, as conflict may affect empowerment on the long
run. In the short run, conflict may have a direct effect on SGBV through
perpetration by armed groups, potentially in a strategic manner (Baaz
Eriksson and Stern 2013; Kirby 2015). This caused the topic to be on the
international agenda, as a ``weapon of war''. However, in the long run
there is a more indirect effect as well: conflict causes the breakdown
of norms, which may have long-lasting effects. For example, (Kelly et
al. 2018) find that that IPV increased in districts that experienced
conflict in Liberia, while (M√ºller and Tranchant 2019) draw similar
conclusions from data from the Gaza strip. (Saile et al. 2013)
investigate the correlates of IPV for a sample of conflict-exposed women
in Northern Uganda. They find that while the level of conflict exposure
predicts physical violence, sexual violence is more associated with the
level of childhood familial violence. This link between current and past
experiences of violence suggests that the effect of conflict on violence
is deeper than just the direct effect. People traumatized during the
conflict (either because they were victims or perpetrators) are more
likely to be victimized later on.

In answering the question what the main drivers of SGBV are, I thus
consider two main drivers: the position of women in Congolese society
and conflict. Within conflict, I distinguish between historic conflict
(here I use pre-2012 data) with long-term, indirect, effects and recent
conflict (up to one year prior to the interview) with short-term, direct
effects. I argue that the indirect long-term effects of conflict are
likely to be related to the position of women, through changing norms,
while more recent conflict events may not have had an additional impact
on norms yet. For empowerment, I use a bargaining game, and survey
questions that determine women's pre-marriage relative status.

This paper contributes to the empirical evidence base on the incidence
of SGBV in Eastern Congo by drawing on a sample of beneficiaries of
development assistance projects in South Kivu province, in the Eastern
DRC. While the selection of respondents was not done to produce a
representative sample for the province, it does not suffer from the same
problems that clinic-based surveys have, allowing me to compare victims
of SGBV with non-victims. Data on SGBV comes from a list experiment, a
technique which has been gaining popularity as a way to obtain
information on sensitive topics (see e.g. Sniderman, Tetlock, and Piazza
1991; Holbrook and Krosnick 2010; Bulte and Lensink 2019; Peterman et
al. 2018; LaBrie and Earleywine 2000; Corstange 2009). Put briefly, list
experiments allow group-level analysis of SGBV victimization, without
individuals revealing their own victimization status. This eliminates
the need for respondents to withhold information and thus reduces the
social desirability bias that results (Blair and Imai 2012). Such bias
may explain the fact that studies on the drivers of SGBV often
contradict each other. While one study finds conflict-related
perpetrators are responsible for the majority of cases of SGBV (Johnson
et al. 2010), another finds intimate partners as the most common
culprits (Peterman, Palermo, and Bredenkamp 2011). Stark et al. (2017)
provides an example of how different methodologies can provide different
answers: when using Audio Assisted Self-Interviews (ACASI) they find
that intimate partners are the main perpetrators of SBV. However, in
complementary group discussions, where social desirability bias is
likely to be present, respondents did not bring up intimate partners at
all.

I combine list experiments with detailed survey data on the household
and outcomes from behavioural experiments, which allows for a rich
characterization of victims of SGBV. Because such a characterization is
lacking thus far, this data is useful in addressing and preventing SGBV.
Moreover, while the potential drivers of SGBV mentioned above --
conflict and empowerment -- have been studied in isolation, this paper
contributes by analysing these in one framework.

I find high victimization rates in my sample: 30\% of the women report
SGBV in the past twelve months. These victims are likely to be married
to higher-status men, have low intra-household bargaining power, and
have been exposed to violent conflict to the extent where they have lost
family or household members before 2012 (two years before the list
experiment). I find no evidence of a link between SGBV and recent
conflict exposure. These findings are consistent with recent findings in
the literature that conflict has long-lasting impact on SGBV through
IPV. This paper is structured as follows: first I describe the research
setting, the sample, and then the various sources of data. The
subsequent section describes my empirical framework, which revolves
around the use of a list experiment. I then present the results of the
analyses. In the concluding section I contextualize the findings and
present policy implications.

\section*{Background}\label{background}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Background}

Congo's 2006 constitution grants equal rights to men and women. In
practice, however, women hold an inferior position in Congolese society.
This is reflected in social and economic outcomes. The literacy rates
among women and girls aged 15-24 is 73.6\% (compared to 91.2\% among men
and boys of the same age); only 8.5\% of women have completed secondary
education (compared to 16.2\% of the men); while 67\% of women work,
only 7.8\% work outside of agriculture or trading and services (MPSMRM,
MSP, and ICF International 2014). Within the household, women occupy an
inferior position as well: the husband is the head by law, and marital
rape is not considered a crime (Kilonzo et al. 2009).

In addition to the difficulties inherent to their inferior position,
women have faced widespread human rights abuses during the conflicts
that have swept the country since the mid 1990s. South Kivu (the setting
for the present study) has been greatly affected by these conflicts. The
first Congo war started with an invasion by Rwanda and armed groups
supported by Rwanda to clear perpetrators of the Rwanda genocide from
the refugee camps in the east of the country, putting the province on
the front line. Throughout this First Congo War (1996-1997), the Second
Congo War (1998-2003) and the subsequent fragile peace, ethnic tensions
have remained high throughout the province, resulting in frequent
localized bursts of violence (see e.g. Verwijen 2016). While some of the
human rights abuses during these phases of the conflict occurred during
large-scale attacks on civilians, often they occurred during ambushes
while women were conducting their day-to-day tasks (Freedman 2011; Human
Rights Watch 2002). Women were often assaulted by multiple perpetrators.
These were not only members of rebel groups, but also the government
army (Human Rights Watch 2009).

The consequences of (conflict-related) SGBV for the victims have been
well-researched. It has severe mental and physical health consequences
(Johnson et al. 2010). However, due to the remote nature and lack of
resources, victims have difficulty finding professional help, often
having to travel more than a day to clinics (Harvard Humanitarian
Initiative 2009; Kohli et al. 2012). The negative consequences persist
until long after the event, as victims face stigmatization within their
communities and households (Albutt et al. 2017; Harvard Humanitarian
Initiative 2009).

The adverse consequences of conflict-related SGBV do not remain limited
to the direct victims. The violence against women during the conflict
resulted in a change in norms, where armed groups were no longer the
main perpetrators of SGBV, but civilians (including intimate partners)
(Freedman 2011). Risk factors for sexual IPV include partner problematic
use of alcohol and partner controlling behaviours (Babalola,
Gill-Bailey, and Dodo 2014). While the Congolese government has made
attempts to address the situation, such as through the Law on the
Suppression of Sexual Violence, implementation of these measures has
been marred by the general lack of resources state authority in the
country (Steiner et al. 2009).

\section*{Sample}\label{sample}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Sample}

The main source of data for this study is the gender module from a
household survey that was undertaken in 2014 as the endline survey for
the evaluation of Dutch development aid. This evaluation concerned
projects ran by four NGOs in the territories of Kabare, Fizi and Uvira,
and the commune of Bagira.\footnote{In the remainder of the paper, I
  will consider Kabare and Bagira to be one ``territory'', since the
  selected communities in Kabare and Bagira are located close together,
  in the peri-urban zone of Bukavu.} The baseline for this evaluation
was done in 2012. Half of the respondents were selected from communities
that benefited from the projects, the other half were selected from
comparable households in non-intervention communities. These projects
were about agriculture, women's rights and education. Overall, the
beneficiaries of the projects were vulnerable, mostly rural, households.
An indicator for being beneficiary to any of these projects is included
in the full analysis below. In total data was collected in 73
communities. In each community, baseline data was collected on 15
households in 2012; however, due to attrition, 2014 data is available
for an average of 12 households per community, for a total of 889
households.

The sampling procedure outlined here is thus unlikely to have produced a
nationally (or even provincially) representative sample. In Table
\hyperref[tab:dhs_compare]{1}, I present a comparison across selected
demographics between the full study sample (column 3), and the
representative sample from the DHS Program (columns 1-2). Women in the
study sample are older, and less likely to have finished school, than
the provincial average in South Kivu.

Not all households participated fully in the gender module. Where
possible, it was administered to both the head of the household and
their spouse, so that there were a Female and a Male Respondent to the
interview \footnote{In tables, I refer to Male and Female Respondents as
  MR and FR respectively.}. In the vast majority of the cases, the
husband is considered the head, but it was left open to the respondents
to indicate the head. Table \hyperref[tab:bargsample]{2} displays how
the sample is built up. In total, there were 889 respondents to the
survey. In 593 households, the Female Respondent (the wife of the
household head or the female head) consented to responding to the gender
module. In 1 household, the female respondent refused; in 5, the Female
Respondent was absent during the interview, and in 290 households the
head of the household had no wife, and there was thus no Female
Respondent. In 470 households, the Male Respondent (usually the
household head) consented to the module, 6 refused, 255 Male Respondents
were absent, and in 158 households the head of the household was an
unmarried woman, meaning that there was no Male Respondent. In 184
households, both husband and wife responded to the module. Efforts to
increase this number, by tracking down absent household heads, were
constricted by the limited time field teams had in each community due to
the security situation at the time of field work. As a consequence of
this, sample sizes between various analyses are different: analyses
relying on both partners being present - e.g.~for the bargaining game -
will have a lower sample size than others.

The selection of respondents to the gender module is unlikely to have
been random. In column 4 of Table \hyperref[tab:dhs_compare]{1} selected
demographics for the Female Respondents to the gender module are
presented. The respondents are slightly older than the full sample, and
considerably older than the provincial average. They are slightly more
likely to have completed secondary school than the full sample, but less
likely than the provincial average. In Table
\hyperref[tab:sample_selection]{6}, I present results from logit models
to find correlations between household characteristics and participation
in the gender module. The dependent columns of the columns are whether
the wife, the husband and the couple participated in the gender module,
respectively. There are some selection effects. Households that own tin
roofs, are more likely to have a Female Respondent. In households that
own livestock, it was less likely that there was a female respondent to
the gender module, and more likely to have male respondent. The final
analysis below will include these as controls.

\section*{Methods}\label{methods}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Methods}

This paper combines data from the 2014 and 2012 rounds of the survey,
with ACLED data. The gender module from the 2014 survey is the main
source of data for this paper. The module was administered separately to
Male and Female Respondent (with a small part being administered
jointly). It contained (i) a list experiment designed to elicit the
incidence of SGBV among Female Respondents; (ii) a risk bargaining game
to elicit the relative intra-household bargaining position of the Male
and Female Respondent; and (iii) a set of propositions to collect
detailed information on gender attitudes. I present the List Experiment,
and the analysis thereof, in more detail in the Empirical Framework
below.

\end{longtable}

The risk bargaining game in the gender module was modified from
(Martinsson, Sutter, and Carlsson 2009). In the game, the respondents
chose between a set of six risky lotteries, based on (Eckel and Grossman
2002). The lotteries presented ranged from fairly low-risk ones -- where
low and high pay-out were nearly equal -- to high-risk one -- where
there was a large difference between high and low pay-outs (see Table
\hyperref[tab:bargaining]{3} for details of the lotteries). The Male and
Female Respondents first chose privately (without knowing their
partner's choice), and then jointly. By comparing the couple decision
with the individual decision, I obtain an indicator for bargaining
power: the closer the couple decision is to the Female Respondent's
decision -- relative to the Male Respondent's decision -- the higher her
bargaining power. The difference between the procedure used by
(Martinsson, Sutter, and Carlsson 2009) and the one here, is that they
use a risk experiment based on (Holt and Laury 2002); a more complicated
experiment compared to Eckel and Grossman (2002). This added
complication may cause some participants to not fully understand the
procedure, leading to poor results (Dave et al. 2010). Given the low
numeracy of the subjects, I implemented the simpler of the two
experiments.

I draw on two sources for conflict data: data from the 2012 round of the
survey, and ACLED data from 2013-2014. The 2012 data contains detailed
information of the conflict history of the respondents dating back to
the start of the First Congo War in 1996. Among other things,
respondents were asked whether they lost family members, whether they
lost property, and when these events took place. I use this to construct
indicators for historic victimization, which may have indirect effects
on SGBV victimization. Due to time constraints, the 2014 round of the
survey did not contain a detailed conflict exposure module. In order to
get more detailed information on recent victimization, complement the
household-level data with more recent data from the Armed Conflict
Location \& Event Data Project {[}ACLED; Raleigh et al. (2010){]}. The
2014 data contains GPS coordinates for all interviewed households. Using
these coordinates, I can link households to nearby conflict events from
the ACLED database that took place within the 12 months preceding the
interview. Because this data then coincides with the window for SGBV
used here, any direct effects from conflict -- like perpetration of SGBV
by armed groups -- will be captured by this indicator. However, while
this data is more recent, it does not capture individual experience;
only exposure based on the distance from the household to conflict
events.

\section*{Empirical Strategy}\label{empirical-strategy}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Empirical Strategy}

A major concern in collecting data on SGBV is reporting bias.
Respondents are unlikely to be comfortable to truthfully answer
questions about SGBV. Respondents may want to hide undesirable answers,
leading to what's called social desirability bias. Not only may this
lead to an underestimate of the incidence of SGBV, the unwillingness to
divulge information may be correlated to the identity of the
perpetrators: people may be more willing to divulge victimization from
armed groups, than from intimate partners (Stark et al. 2017). This
non-random nature of non-response would thus lead to an underestimate of
the incidence of SGBV, and biased estimates for the correlates of SGBV
when using direct questions. This is why such direct questions are not
used in list experiments. Instead, interviewers present respondents with
a list of issues and ask them to indicate the number of issues from the
list they have faced. By adding the sensitive item to the list of issues
for half of the respondents (randomly selected), estimates for incidence
of the sensitive item can be obtained by comparing the mean number of
issues faced in both groups (hence ``item count technique'' as an
alternative name for list experiments). The advantage is thus that
answers are guaranteed to be anonymous: the interviewer (or the data
analyst) does not know the number of non-sensitive issues the respondent
faces and so has no way of knowing the answer to sensitive item. This
anonymity removes the need to hide the answer, and thus the social
desirability bias.

Over the past decades, list experiments have grown in popularity as a
way to obtain accurate data on sensitive topics. (Holbrook and Krosnick
2010) review 48 studies using list experiments, and found that they are
effective at decreasing social desirability bias. Comparing studies that
use list experiments with studies that do not, they find that reporting
rates of sensitive items are higher in studies using list experiments.
It is therefore not surprising that this approach has been applied to a
wide range of topics, such as sensitive political opinions (Frye et al.
2017; Blair, Imai, and Lyall 2014; Meng, Pan, and Yang 2017; Corstange
2009), over-reporting of voting (Holbrook and Krosnick 2010), risky
behaviours (LaBrie and Earleywine 2000) and SGBV (Bulte and Lensink
2019; Peterman et al. 2018).

For the list experiment in this study, the female respondents were
randomly divided into two groups. This was done by the electronic survey
software (ODK), based on the randomly assigned ID codes. I follow (Imai
2011) in calling these groups Treatment and Control. An interviewer told
each respondent: ``I will read 4 \emph{(or 5)} problems that women can
experience. These can be sensitive problems. When you've experienced a
problem in the last year, please drop one of the balls to the ground. I
will not look at when you drop these balls, and only want to know the
total number of balls at the end. In the past 12 months, did you
experience...

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Lack of food;
\item
  Lack of money;
\item
  Theft;
\item
  Sterility; and,
\item
  Sexual Violence (Treatment group only)''
\end{itemize}

The interviewer only presented women randomly selected to be in the
treatment group with the fifth item (Sexual Violence). I selected the
four control items in such a way that it is unlikely women in the sample
face none, or all, of the issues. In such cases the interviewer knows
the respondent's answer to the sensitive issue ("no" if the total number
of issues is 0, "yes" if the total number is 5). Not all the control
items are non-sensitive, as the item ``sterility'' is a sensitive item.
This was done to reduce respondent suspicion when one sensitive items is
juxtaposed with a number of completely non-sensitive items (see Chuang
et al. (2019) for a more detailed explanation). After all items were
read, the interviewer asked the respondent to count the number of balls,
and report the number. The questionnaire was field tested prior to field
work to ensure that respondents understood these concepts. All
interviewers were thoroughly trained in the protocols, and the
electronic questionnaire was programmed in such a way to ensure
compliance to the protocol.

A crucial assumption for the list experiment is that the randomization
ensures that Treatment and Control groups are identical. Table
\hyperref[tab:balance]{\[tab:balance\]} (Column 7) provides a comparison
of the two groups within the sample. The treatment and control group are
not perfectly balanced across some of the variables. However, an F-test
on the differences between treatment and control being jointly equal to
zero fails to reject the null-hypothesis that they are equal (p=0.20).
This suggests that the differences found are due to chance, rather than
any bias in the randomization procedure.

While the indirect nature of list experiments prevents reporting bias,
this does come at a cost of efficiency in statistical analysis. The
incidence is easily computed by subtracting the mean of issues faced in
the control group from the mean number of issues in the treatment group.
This means that sample sizes have to be far larger for list experiments
than for direct questions.

In a regression framework, the incidence would be estimated as follows
(Holbrook and Krosnick 2010):

\[\label{eq:basic}
NumIssues_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Treatment_i + \epsilon_i\]

Where \(NumIssues_i\) is the number of issues experienced by respondent
\(i\), and \(Treatment_i\) is her treatment assignment. Coefficient
\(\beta_1\) yields the estimate for the incidence. To find correlates of
SGBV, equation \hyperref[eq:basic]{\[eq:basic\]} can be augmented using
interaction terms as follows: \[\label{eq:interaction}
NumIssues_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Treatment_i + \beta_2 X_i + \beta_3 Treatment_i X_i + \epsilon_i\]

Where \(X_i\) is an explanatory variable and coefficient \(\beta_3\)
gives the estimate for the additional incidence of SGBV associated with
a unit increase of \(X\). This can be easily modified to allow for more
variables. Again, this is much less efficient than when using direct
questioning. By using more sophisticated methods proposed by Imai (2011)
(and implemented by (Tsai 2019) in Stata), more efficient estimates can
be obtained.

\section*{Results}\label{results}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Results}

Comparison of means of issues faced: treatment vs. control.

In this section, I will first compare the results of the list experiment
in the whole sample, then in different sub-groups. I then present
results from a full multivariate regression that aims to minimize
potential bias caused by confounding variables.

In the full sample, the difference between the group who were presented
with only four issues (the Control group) and the group who were
presented four issues plus SGBV (the Treatment group) is the estimate of
the incidence of SGBV. The average number of issues reported by the
control group is , while the number if issues reported by the treatment
group is (see Figure \hyperref[fig:meancompare_overall]{1}). The
difference of implies that the incidence of SGBV is \% in this sample.
The p-value for a t-test on this difference is . This estimate appears
substantially higher than previous estimates. These previous estimates
(e.g. Peterson et al. 2018; Stark et al. 2017; Johnson et al. 2010)
arrive at a similar rate of victimization, but over the life of the
respondent, whereas here we only consider victimization the past twelve
months. A higher incidence is expected, since the sample is non random,
drawing mostly from vulnerable rural households.

\subsection*{Conflict}\label{conflict}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Conflict}

Comparison of means of issues faced across conflict exposure.

With respect to conflict, I distinguish between recent conflict (as
indicated by ACLED events that happened within the 12 months before the
list experiment) and historic conflict (1996-2012). Historic conflict
can only have had an indirect effect on SGBV, e.g.~through changed
norms, as the list experiment only covers SGBV events within the past 12
months. Recent conflict can have a direct effect through perpetration
during the conflict event.

I first analyse victimization patterns by comparing sub-groups of the
respondents, based on one variable at a time. A full, multivariate
analysis will follow. With respect to conflict, I consider three ways of
splitting the sample in sub-groups: (i) respondents who live in
households that indicated (or not) in 2012 to have suffered loss of (or
damage to) property, including agricultural fields, due to conflict;
(ii) whether the respondent's household indicated in 2012 to have lost
any household members or family as a consequence of the conflict (or
not); and (iii) whether number of instances of violence against
civilians in ACLED data within a 10km radius during the past twelve
months was higher than the number of instances for the median household
(nor not) \footnote{The results presented here are robust to using
  number of battles or number of fatalities rather than the instances of
  violence against civilians; using 5,15,20, 25 or 30km as a radius; and
  using a continuous variable, rather than a binary variable.}.

Conflict exposure was high in the sample (see Table
\hyperref[tab:balance]{\[tab:balance\]}): \% of the respondents reported
having lost property due to conflict between 1996 and 2012. \% of the
respondents reported the loss of a family or household member. Again,
conflict exposure was high, even when limiting the time-span to one year
prior to the data collection. The mean number of violent conflicts
within a 10km radius was . This exposure differs across the territories
(Table \hyperref[tab:conflict_by_terr]{4}). While respondents in all
territories were greatly affected by conflict prior to 2012, those in
Fizi were hit harder. In the 12 months before the survey however, Uvira
was in the midst in an outbreak of violence, related to conflicts
surrounding the succession of traditional rulers in the chefferies of
Bafuliiro and Plaine de la Ruzizi. In fact, weeks before data collection
in 2014 took place, 30 civilians were killed in Mutarule, a village in
the Plaine, but not in my sample. This difference in recent and historic
conflict patterns means that households with conflict exposure pre-2012
are not more likely to be victimized in 2013-2014 (see also Table
\hyperref[tab:determinants_regression]{\[tab:determinants_regression\]}).
Associations between pre-2012 violence and SGBV will thus not be the
result of re-targeting of the same households.

: Conflict exposure by territory

The results of the sub-group analysis is displayed graphically in Figure
\hyperref[fig:meancompare_conf]{2}. From the top two panels, it can be
seen that the difference between treatment and control is greater among
conflict-victimized respondents than among non-conflict victimized
respondents. The size of these differences is listed in Table
\hyperref[tab:meandiff_conf]{\[tab:meandiff_conf\]}. Among those that
indicated not having lost property, the difference in number of issues
faced between treatment and control is 0.19, implying a SGBV
victimization rate of 19\%. The difference between Treatment and Control
among respondents who did lose property was 0.38. The difference in the
differences between these groups of 0.19 issues (this corresponds to
coefficient \(\beta_3\) in equation
\hyperref[eq:interaction]{\[eq:interaction\]} above) is not
statistically significant. When splitting the sample by households
indicating having lost a family or household member to conflict before
2012, the difference-in-difference estimate is 0.37, indicating that
incidence of SGBV among respondents who lost family due to conflict is
37 percentage points higher than among those who have not. This effect
is significant at the 5\% level. Note that the SGBV could not have
happened during the same time as the conflict event(s): the SGBV
happened twelve months before the interview in 2014, while the conflict
events happened before 2012.

When looking at more recent exposure to conflict, no clear patterns
emerge (see bottom panel of Figure \hyperref[fig:meancompare_conf]{2}).
SGBV incidence among women who have more instances of violence near them
than the median is 7 percentage points lower than women who do not
(bottom row of Table
\hyperref[tab:meandiff_conf]{\[tab:meandiff_conf\]}). However, this is
not statistically significant. I thus find no evidence of large-scale
direct perpetration of SGBV by armed groups in the one year before data
collection, but also no evidence of indirect effects of recent conflict.

The fact that conflict before 2012 correlates with SGBV, but recent
conflict does not, points at a more complex relationship between
conflict and SGBV than a simple direct effect due to perpetration by
armed groups. It is more likely that violence has an indirect effect
through changed norms. The fact that recent conflict seems not to have
an indirect effect either, may mean that this change of norms takes
time, or that the nature of recent conflict is different from historic
conflict.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{figures/meancompare_mar.eps}
\caption{Comparison of means of issues faced by pre-marriage
status.}\label{fig:meancompare_mar}
\end{figure}

I then create sub-groups based on the intra-household bargaining
position of the respondents. I compare women across two variables.
First, I compare women across the relative status of the partners at the
time of marriage, by using family land-holdings as a proxy for status.
The 2014 survey contained a section on the marriage of the (spouse of
the) household head. In this section, respondents were asked whose
family owned more land, prior to the marriage: the wife's, the
husband's, or whether they had equal land. This choice of proxy was made
in consultation with local partners (including NGOs and universities),
and based on the importance of agriculture in the area. In \% of the
cases, the husband's family had more land, in \% of the cases the wife's
family did. Note that only households responded to this question, as
some refused to give a definite answer (Table
\hyperref[tab:balance]{\[tab:balance\]}).

The second intra-household aspect I explore is derived from the results
of the bargaining game played with couples during the 2014 survey. I
create three groups, based on whether the joint decision is closer to
the husband's decision, to the wife's, or if the distance is equal. The
mean choice of the Female Respondents in the sample was ; the Male
Respondents were slightly more risk-averse: their mean choice was . In
\% of the cases, the couple decision was closest to the Male
Respondent's choice. In \% it was closer to the Female Respondent's.
Note that the size of the sample here is smaller than for the other
variables presented, as it was not always possible to have both the Male
and Female Respondent present at the same time for the interview.

Figure \hyperref[fig:meancompare_mar]{3} displays the results from the
sub-group analysis. Overall, the difference between treatment and
control is larger for the sub-groups of respondents with a worse
intra-household bargaining position, indicating that the incidence of
SGBV is higher among these respondents. As suggested by the large size
of the 95\% confidence intervals, some of these sub-groups are small. In
Table \hyperref[tab:meadifftab_mar]{\[tab:meadifftab_mar\]}, these
differences are tabulated, including the sizes of the sub-groups.
However, the variable definitions are slightly different, due to the
difficulties in interpreting difference-in-differences between three
sub-groups. For each variable, two comparisons are tabulated: one,
comparing households where the female respondents had the better
bargaining position with the two other sub-groups, and one comparing
households where the male respondent had the better bargaining position
with the two other sub-groups. Female respondent in households where the
family of the husband had the most land prior to marriage were victims
of SGBV in 50\% of the cases, while 16\% of the other respondents were.
The difference of 33 percentage points is statistically significant at
the 10\% level. In the other comparison for the same variable, the
difference is even larger, but not statistically significant; perhaps
due to the low number of women with more pre-marital status than their
husbands. The differences when split by results from the bargaining game
are larger still: 57 or 61 percentage points, depending on the groups
used.

While these results may suggest that IPV is an important driver of SGBV,
the fact that I have no information on perpetrators means that this is
not certain.

\subsection*{Multivariate Regression
analysis}\label{multivariate-regression-analysis}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Multivariate Regression analysis}

In the preceding sections, I examined univariate relations between
variables of interest and the incidence of SGBV. However, such analysis
may suffer from omitted variables and spurious correlations. Here I move
to a richer specification, in order to prevent such biases, and assess
the relative importance of each driver. I expand equation
\hyperref[eq:interaction]{\[eq:interaction\]} to simultaneously include
indicators for conflict and intra-household bargaining position. To
reduce the risk of multi-collinearity, I do not include the full set of
variables discussed above, but select one indicator for each, guided by
the results obtained above. A key criterion for selection is the number
of respondents for each indicator. The analysis of list experiments
suffers from rapid loss of power due to the indirect nature of the
analysis. To mitigate this, indicators that are available for large
groups of respondents were selected. For conflict, I include both the
indicator for household member killed before 2012 (as an indicator for
historic conflict) and violence against civilians from the ACLED data
(as an indicator for recent conflict); and for intra-household
bargaining position a dummy for the husband's family having the most
land. I use the KICT Stata package developed by Tsai (2019) to estimate
these models. Interpretation of the coefficients is the same as equation
\hyperref[eq:interaction]{\[eq:interaction\]}, but estimation is more
efficient.

In order to reduce missing variable bias, I include a set of controls
that likely (co-) determine SGBV and the right-hand side variables
listed above. A full analysis of these determinants is provided in the
Appendix, Table
\hyperref[tab:determinants_regression]{\[tab:determinants_regression\]}.
In addition, I include variables that determine sample selection, as
displayed in Table \hyperref[tab:sample_selection]{6}. In particular, I
include the age of the Female Respondent; indicators for the education
of the Male and Female respondents; asset holdings of the household,
including livestock and a tin roof; territory dummies; and an indicator
for being in the treatment group of any of the projects under evaluation
for the survey.

In Table \hyperref[tab:results_regression]{5} I display the results of
these regressions. In columns 1-3 I rerun the univariate models from
above. Results are the same as before: both conflict history and
intra-household bargaining are associated with increased incidence of
SGBV. I In column 4 I present the full model. I find that women in a
marriage where their husband's family had more land before the marriage,
are percentage points more likely than other women to be victim of SGBV.
Note that the pre-marriage status of women within the household is
uncorrelated to conflict (see Table
\hyperref[tab:determinants_regression]{\[tab:determinants_regression\]}).
Women who live in households that lost a family or household member due
to conflict prior to 2012 are percentage points more likely to be
victimized by SGBV than other women. Of note is also the negative
associated of the Female Respondent having a secondary education: in
this linear model, women with secondary education are percentage points
less likely to be victimized. The fact that the absolute value of this
coefficient is higher than 1 is due to the fact that linear models do
not constrain predictions of probabilities between 0 and 1.

The finding that conflict history is associated with an increase in
SGBV, while recent conflict is not, points to the indirect relationship
between conflict and SGBV, where conflict may affect SGBV rates not
through perpetration by armed groups, but by an increase in IPV. The
notion that IPV is a major driver of SGBV is reinforced by the fact that
both intra-household bargaining position and secondary education are
negatively associated with SGBV. This suggests that the position of
women is important in protecting them from human rights violations.

Caution should be taken with this interpretation, as results presented
here are not necessarily causal: women with higher education may differ
from other women in non-observable ways, and face lower victimization
because of that, rather than education. Furthermore, no data exists on
the perpetrators of the violence. The method of a list experiment does
not allow for follow-up questions to victimized women, as the
interviewer cannot know who to ask these follow up questions to.

\section*{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Conclusion}

In this paper, I analysed the results from a list experiment, in order
to identify potential drivers of SGBV in Eastern Congo. Prevalence of
SGBV is high in Congo, however little is known about the victims, and
the drivers of victimization. In order to address this, I combined the
results from the list experiment with rich data, including a household
survey, a bargaining game, and conflict data.

The incidence rates I find are very high: 30\% of the women in the
sample report having been the victim of SGBV in the past twelve months.
Most data collected on lifetime victimization arrives at similar rates,
suggesting that this estimate for a one-year window is high. The rate
found here may thus not be nationally, or regionally, representative.
This is likely due to the fact that women in the sample were recruited
among beneficiaries and potential beneficiaries of programs aimed at
assisting the most vulnerable women and households. It is to be expected
that incidence rates in this group are higher than for other groups. In
fact, I find that secondary schooling rates among women in my sample is
lower than the national or provincial average, and that incidence of
SGBV among women who have attended secondary school are significantly
lower than among other women.

When examining the backgrounds of the victims, I find that they are
likely to be married to higher-status men, have low intra-household
bargaining power, and have been exposed to violent conflict to the
extent where they have lost family or household members before 2012 (two
years before the list experiment). When comparing these effects in one
analysis, I find that the effect of intra-household dynamics is larger
than the effect of conflict. This contrasts with popular frames where
the conflict is seen as the primary driver of SGBV, but is in line with
previous literature suggesting that intimate partners are more likely
perpetrators of SGBV than members of armed groups (see e.g. Peterman,
Palermo, and Bredenkamp 2011).

Taken together, these finding imply that human rights violations do not
end when the conflict ends. The disruption of social norms may cause
women (and perhaps men, but the present data set does not cover them) to
suffer from violence long after the last shot has been fired. A focus of
rape as a ``weapon of war'' may thus be too narrow to address these
violations. This is not to say there direct perpetration of SGBV by
armed forces is not a problem in Congo. There is ample proof that
large-scale violations have been committed by armed forces, especially
historically. The conflict has undergone changes throughout the years,
and with it the kinds of human rights violations perpetrated. The
massacre in Mutarule in the weeks before data collections did see 30
innocent civilians murdered, but there are no reports of rape.
Furthermore, focusing efforts to assist women on the victims from such
attacks risks missing women victimized in their homes, far away from any
fighting. Structural changes encouraging women's education and tangibly
raising their status are needed to protect these women as well.

There are three large caveats with these findings: (i) causal
interpretation is difficult due to the cross-sectional nature of the
data; (ii) little analysis could be done on the perpetrators of the
violence, as indirect questioning precludes probing into this. More
research is needed to to address these important issues; and (iii) I did
not collect data on the victimization of men. More research is needed to
address these.
