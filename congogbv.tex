\section*{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph{}
%Hook
Eastern DR Congo has been called the "rape capital of the world". Much of this has been linked to the decades of violence that the region has seen over the past decades. Various armed groups have used Gender Based Violence (GBV) as a weapon against the population. This has put the issue on the radar of the international community. Today, most of the NGOs operating in the region focus on GBV, either exclusively, or as part of broader programmes. The 2018 Nobel Peace prize was awarded to Dr. Denis Mukwege, for his work on victims of GBV at Bukavu's Panzi Hospital.

\paragraph{}
%Research question
The issue of GBV is complicated. While the armed conflict is universally seen as a large driver of GBV, customs and tradition leave Congolese women in a powerless position. This paper aims to provide quantitative evidence on the correlates of sexual violence.

%Antecedents
Antecedents of this paper include (perhaps weave this in with contribution):
\begin{itemize}
	\item Conflict literature on Congo:
	\item GBV literature:
%\cite{Hilhorst2018}:  question whether the reponse of the international community should be labelled a hype.
%\cite{Quattrochi2019}: "Empowerment programs often target women who have survived sexual and gender-basedviolence (SGBV), with the justification that these women may develop disempowered beliefs as a copingmechanism, or face greater barriers to, or derive greater benefits from, the adoption of empowered beliefs andpreferences."
%\cite{Porter2019}: argues that rape as a weapon of war is not helpful. It is embedded in existing mores and customs. 
%close to my paper: \cite{Stark2017} assess disclosement bias.
	\item List experiment literature: 
%Classic example: The 1991 National Race and Politics Survey (\cite{Sniderman1991}). Used to measure racial prejudice. Recently, more of of them have been done. \cite{Imai2011}: introduction of new estimator. \cite{Blair2012}: overview of literature. \cite{Tsai2019}: implement methods in Stata.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
%Contribution
While from the literature it is obvious that GBV is endemic in Eastern Congo, it is difficult to get quantitative evidence on the problem. The area is poorly accessible to research teams, and women may be unwilling to divulge information on victimization due to the stigma involved. We collected data in the region in 2012, as part of the evaluation of Dutch development efforts. The questionnaires included a section on gender. As part of this section, a list experiment was administered.

\section*{Background and data}

%to do in this section: desctibe N.varlabels
The data for this study was collected as part of an evaluation of Dutch development aid in 2012. This evaluation concerned projects ran by three NGOs in the territories of Fizi and Uvira in South Kivu province. A household survey formed part of this evaluation. The final module of this survey dealt with gender issues, and was administered to an adult female in the household.  To collect data on the sensitive topic of GBV, this module contained a list experiment. For this, the respondents were randomly divided into two groups. Each group was presented with a number of issues that women can realistically face in Eastern Congo. They then indicated how many of the issues they themselves had faced. The first group (Group 0) was presented with the following issues:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Lack of food;
	\item Lack of money;
	\item Theft; and,
	\item Sterility.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
 Women in the second group (Group 1) were presented with the same four items, but a fifth item was added: Sexual Violence. While this means I cannot know who among our respondents was the victim of GBV, I can compare the means of the number of issues between the groups to arrive at an estimate of GBV. By comparing means between sub-samples, and by using more sophisticated methods proposed by \citet{Imai2011}, I can find the correlates of GBV.

%build up the story a bit more:
%	* Average incidence; include graphs of mean differences?
%	* Present some sample splits in this figure as well: conflict; marriage types.
%	* Present full models

%	* Present sample splits: married before conflict vs. married after conflict. 
%	* Sexual Violence can come from a number of sources. Salient in the DRC is conflict-related GBV.

%	* Is there difference for women married "after" the war vs. before the war?

\paragraph{}
First, I compare the number of issues faced by the two groups of women. The difference between the group who were presented with only four issues (the control group) and the group who were presented four issues plus GBV is my estimate of the incidence of GBV. The average number of issues reported by the control group is \incid{overall}{meanballs00}, while the number if issues reported by the treatment group is \incid{overall}{meanballs10} (see Figure \ref{fig:meancompare1}). The difference of \incid{overall}{incidence0} implies that the incidence of GBV is \incid{overall}{incidence0_pct}\% in this sample. This number of slightly higher than some estimates \citep{Quattrochi2019}.

  \label{fig:meancompare1}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{}
I then compare the number of issues faced in several sub-groups. First, I compare across relative status. I compare women in marriages in which the family of the husband had more land at the time of marriage to other women in \ref{fig:meancompare2}. In the group where the husband had more status, the average number of issues was \incid{husbmoreland}{meanballs01} for the control group, and \incid{husbmoreland}{meanballs11} for the treatment group. This implies a rate of GBV of \incid{husbmoreland}{incidence1_pct}. In the other group (which includes women who had more status, and couple with equal status), the average number of issues was \incid{husbmoreland}{meanballs00} for the control group, and \incid{husbmoreland}{meanballs10} for the treatment group. This implies a rate of GBV of \incid{husbmoreland}{incidence0_pct}\%.

  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{\figureloc/meancompare2.png}
  \caption{Comparison of means of issues faced: victimized vs non-victimized.}
  \label{fig:meancompare2}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{}
Second, I compare across the results of a bargaining game played with couples: I compare women in couples where the coupe result was closer to the husband's decisions to other women. The other group includes women in couples where the couple's decision was closer the woman's, and those where the couple's decision was precisely between the two decisions. See figure \ref{fig:meancompare3}. In the group where the couple decision was closest to the husband, the average number of issues was \incid{riskheadcloser}{meanballs01} for the control group, and \incid{riskheadcloser}{meanballs11} for the treatment group. This implies a rate of GBV of \incid{riskheadcloser}{incidence1_pct}\%. In the other group, the average number of issues was \incid{riskheadcloser}{meanballs00} for the control group, and \incid{riskheadcloser}{meanballs10} for the treatment group. This implies a rate of GBV of \incid{riskheadcloser}{incidence0_pct}\%.

%interpretatie voorbeelden:
%\cite{Meng2017} first simply present mean differences; they then present a maximum likelihood model. Based on this model, they predict mean differences and present this as their quantity of interest. They have replication files online.

%\cite{Imai2011}: himself admits that the coefficients of the maximum likelihood method are difficult to compare. He therefore generates predicted values of shares of people answering affirmitively to the sensitive item for two subgroups.
