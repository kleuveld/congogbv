\section*{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph{}
%Hook
Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) in the Congo has been a prominent area of attention for the international development community over the past decades. Often, the high incidence of SGBV in the country has been linked to the various violent conflicts the country has seen. In general, this link between conflict and SGBV rose to prominence at the end of 1990s, when rape was used strategically by armed actors during conflicts in Rwanda and Bosnia  \citep{Kirby2015}. In Congo in particular, the issue has been on the agenda since 2002 when the NGO Human Rights Watch published a report on the topic \citep{HRW2002}. Since then, the issue has received attention by the UN, governments, NGOs and even celebrities \citep{Baaz2013}. This attention is understandable, as even outside of conflict-settings, the psychological, social and economic costs of SGBV are staggering \citep{Post2002,Peterson2018}. To use this a weapon defies the imagination of Western audiences. Consequently, Congo to nearly become synonymous with rape, even called the ``rape capital of the world''. Tremendous international efforts have been made to implement or support projects to assist the victims of SGBV. The 2018 Nobel Peace prize was awarded to Dr. Denis Mukwege, for his work on victims of SGBV at Bukavu's Panzi Hospital.
 
\paragraph{}
%research question
In this paper, I explore the characteristics of the victims SGBV to assess what factors increase risk of SGBV.In particular, I consider conflict victimization, intra-household dynamics, and poverty as potential characteristics.

\paragraph{}
%Antecedents
While estimates for the incidence of GBV in DR Congo vary, they are invariably high, ranging from 15\% to 40\% \citep{Johnson2010,Peterman2011}. A frequently cited driver for this high rate, is the conflict that has persisted in the country for the past decades. This is particularly true for policy circles, where the framing of SGBV in Congo as ``weapon of war'' is popular \citep{Baaz2013,Kirby2015}. There is empirical evidence that backs up this framing. \cite{Johnson2010} carried out a large-scale survey in Eastern DRC to investigate incidence and perpetrators of GBV. They find that the majority of sexual violence reported by their respondents was conflict-related; of female victims of sexual violence, 74.3\% reported being victim to conflict-related sexual violence. It is therefore not surprising that the topic of GBV in Congo has often been analysed within the context of violence \citep{Baaz2013}. Likewise, the aspect of the conflict that has received the most world-wide media attention has been GBV \citep{Autesserre2012a}.

\paragraph{}
This view of the central role of conflict in sexual violence has come under increasing scrutiny. It has been argued that this focus on the relationship between sexual violence and conflict has been counter-productive, as it has distracted attention from other pressing problems the country faces \citep{Autesserre2012a, Hilhorst2018,Porter2019}. Moreover, it risks missing the civilian perpetrators of SGBV, which are at least equally important as perpetrators from armed groups. There is empirical evidence for this position too. Based on DHS data, \cite{Peterman2011} find that Intimate Partner violence is a large contributor to the incidence of Sexual Violence in Congo. The local NGO community has used the resources provided by the attention that ``rape as a weapon of war'' has brought to Eastern Congo to increase efforts to improve empowerment of women and so prevent SGBV in the first place \citep{Hilhorst2018}. However, it is clear that to this day, women hold a precarious position in Congolese society. For example, views that men have the right to physically abuse their wife if she is disobedient are broadly held \citep{Quattrochi2019}.

\paragraph{}
A large problem underlying the analysis of drivers and dynamics of SGBV is the paucity of reliable data. While one study finds conflict-related perpetrators are responsible for the majority of cases of SGBV \citep{Johnson2010}, another finds intimate partners as the most common culprits \citep{Peterman2011}. \citet{Stark2017} provide a possible explanation for this discrepancy. In a study where 87 women and girls in South Kivu were interviewed using Audio Assisted Self-Interviews (ACASI) techniques,they find that 14\% of respondents reported having been victim of sexual coercion. Half of these were perpetrated by the respondents' husbands or boyfriends. Crucially, in complementary group discussions, respondents did not bring up intimate partners at all. This points at the difficulties of collecting accurate data about GBV, and the importance of data collection methodologies. 
\paragraph{}
%Contribution
This paper contributes to the empirical evidence base on the incidence of GBV in Eastern Congo by using a list experiment to obtain reliable estimates of the incidence of SGBV. List experiments remove the bias in answering sensitive question, by removing the possibility of the researcher (or anyone else) to view individual answers to the sensitive topic. However, group-level analysis is still possible, to provide estimates of correlates of GBV. Combined with rich data from a household survey and behavioural experiments, collected in 2012 and 2014, this approach allows for a rich characterization of victims of GBV. As such a characterization is lacking thusfar, this data can be of tremendous usefulness in addressing and preventing GBV.
%perhaps note that tia finds no predictors for GBV.
\paragraph{}
%Road Map
I find no correlation between victimization of GBV and victimization of the conflict. I do find a strong correlation between victimization of GBV and intra-household dynamics: the result from a bargaining game, and the pre-marriage relative status of the wife and husband. This early draft of the paper is structured as follows: first I describe the research setting and data. I then present the results from various analyses on the list experiments conducted. In the concluding remarks, I contextualize the findings and present policy implications.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Background and data}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{}
%to do in this section: desctibe N.varlabels
The main source of data for this study was collected as part of an evaluation of Dutch development aid in 2014 (with a baseline round in 2012). This evaluation concerned projects ran by three NGOs in the territories of Fizi and Uvira in South Kivu province. A household survey formed part of this evaluation. Data was collected among 902 households in 65 villages. The final module of this survey dealt with gender issues. To collect data on the sensitive topic of GBV, this module contained a list experiment. This list experiment was administered to the head of the household in female-headed households (n=150) or to the spouse of the head of the household (n=439). The total number of respondents to the list experiment is thus 589. This is lower than the overall survey n, as it was not possible to interview a woman for each household: either because the male head was divorced, single or a widower, because the spouse was unavailable, or because the spouse refused to participate.

\paragraph{}
For the list experiment, the respondents were randomly divided into two groups. I follow \cite{Imai2011} in calling these groups Treatment and Control. Each group was presented with a number of issues that women can realistically face in Eastern Congo. They then indicated how many of the issues they themselves had faced. The first group (Control) was presented with the following issues:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Lack of food;
	\item Lack of money;
	\item Theft; and,
	\item Sterility.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
 Women in the second group (Treatment) were presented with the same four items, but a fifth item was added: Sexual Violence. The questionnaire was field tested prior to field work to ensure that respondents understood these concepts. While using a list experiment means I cannot know who among the respondents was the victim of GBV, I can compare the means of the number of issues between the groups to arrive at an estimate of SGBV. By comparing means between sub-samples, and by using more sophisticated methods proposed by \citet{Imai2011} (and implemented by \cite{Tsai2019} in Stata), I can find the correlates of SGBV. 

 \paragraph{}
 In addition to the list experiment, I conducted a household bargaining game modified from \cite{Martinsson2009}. In this, couples choose between a set of six risky lotteries, based on \cite{Eckel2002}. The lotteries presented range from fairly low-risk ones -- where low and high pay-out are nearly equal -- to high-risk one, with a large difference between high and low pay-outs (see Table \ref{tab:bargaining} for details of the lotteries). The respondents first choose individually (without knowing their partner's choice), and then jointly. By comparing the couple decision with the individual decision, I obtain an indicator for barganing power. \cite{Martinsson2009} use a risk experiment based on \cite{Holt2002}, however, this is a more complicated experiment compared to Eckel and Grossman. This added complication may cause participants not fully understanding the procedure, leading to poor results \citep{Dave2010a}. Given the low numeracy of the subjects, I implemented the simpler of the two experiments.

\paragraph{}
First, I compare the number of issues faced by the two groups of women. The difference between the group who were presented with only four issues (the control group) and the group who were presented four issues plus GBV (the treatment group) is my estimate of the incidence of GBV. The average number of issues reported by the control group is \incid{overall1}{mean0}, while the number if issues reported by the treatment group is \incid{overall1}{mean1} (see Figure \ref{fig:meancompare_overall}). The difference of \incid{overall1}{incidence} implies that the incidence of GBV is \incid{overall1}{incidence_pct}\% in this sample. The p-value for a t-test on this difference is \incid{overall1}{p}. This incidence is slightly higher than some estimates \citep{Quattrochi2019}.

  \caption{Comparison of means of issues faced: treatment vs. control.}
  \label{fig:meancompare_overall}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Intra-household dynamics}
\paragraph{}
I then compare the number of issues faced in several sub-groups. First, I focus on marriage dynamics. I compare women across the relative status of the partners at the time of marriage. For this, I use the land held by the partners' families as proxy for status (figure \ref{fig:meancompare_mar1}). Given the importance of agriculture, and conversely land, in the study area, this is a reasonably proxy. In the group where the wife had more status before the marriage (n=\incid{statpar1}{n}), the average number of issues was \incid{statpar1}{mean0} for the control group, and \incid{statpar1}{mean1} for the treatment group. The difference in means implies a rate of GBV of \incid{statpar1}{incidence_pct} (p-value of a t-test on the means = \incid{statpar1}{p}). In the group where the partners were of equal standing (n=\incid{statpar2}{n}), the average number of issues was \incid{statpar2}{mean0} for the control group, and \incid{statpar2}{mean1} for the treatment group. This implies a rate of GBV of \incid{statpar2}{incidence_pct} (p = \incid{statpar2}{p}). In the group where the husband had more status (n=\incid{statpar3}{n}), the average number of issues was \incid{statpar3}{mean0} for the control group, and \incid{statpar3}{mean1} for the treatment group. This implies a rate of GBV of \incid{statpar3}{incidence_pct} (p = \incid{statpar3}{p}).

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{\figureloc/meancompare_mar1.png}
  \caption{Comparison of means of issues faced by pre-marriage status.}
  \label{fig:meancompare_mar1}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{}
The second intra-household aspect I explore is derived from the results of a bargaining game played with couples. Couples first took a decision individually, and then jointly. I then create three groups, based on whether the joint decision is closer to the husband's decision, to the wife's, or if the distance is equal. See figure \ref{fig:meancompare_mar2}. In the group where the couple decision was closest to the wife's decision (n=\incid{bargresult1}{n}), the average number of issues was \incid{bargresult1}{mean0} for the control group, and \incid{bargresult1}{mean1} for the treatment group. This implies a rate of GBV of \incid{bargresult1}{incidence_pct}\% (p = \incid{bargresult1}{p}). In the group where the couple decision was equally close to the husband and wife (n=\incid{bargresult2}{n}), the average number of issues was \incid{bargresult2}{mean0} for the control group, and \incid{bargresult2}{mean1} for the treatment group. This implies a rate of GBV of \incid{bargresult2}{incidence_pct}\% (p = \incid{bargresult2}{p}). In the group where the couple decision was closest to the husband's (n=\incid{bargresult3}{n}), the average number of issues was \incid{bargresult3}{mean0} for the control group, and \incid{bargresult3}{mean1} for the treatment group. This implies a rate of GBV of \incid{bargresult3}{incidence_pct}\% (p = \incid{bargresult3}{p}).

\begin{figure}

  \caption{Comparison of means of issues faced: forced marriage vs. other marriage types.}
  \label{fig:meancompare_mar2}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{}
The final intra-household variable I use to compare women, is their relative contribution to the household's cash income (see figure \ref{fig:meancompare_mar3}). The household questionnaire collected data on all activities of household members, and what the contribution of these activities were to household income. I sum this for all activities for the women in the sample, and compare those who contribute more than 50\% of cash income with those who do not. In the group where the woman does not contribute more than 50\% of cash income (n=\incid{contribcashyn0}{n}), the average number of issues was \incid{contribcashyn0}{mean0} for the control group, and \incid{contribcashyn0}{mean1} for the treatment group. This implies a rate of GBV of \incid{contribcashyn0}{incidence_pct}\% (p = \incid{contribcashyn0}{p}). In the group where the woman does contribute more than 50\% of cash income (n=\incid{contribcashyn1}{n}), the average number of issues was \incid{contribcashyn1}{mean0} for the control group, and \incid{contribcashyn1}{mean1} for the treatment group. This implies a rate of GBV of \incid{contribcashyn1}{incidence_pct}\% (p = \incid{contribcashyn1}{p}). 

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{\figureloc/meancompare_mar3.png}
  \caption{Comparison of means of issues faced across contribution to cash income.}
  \label{fig:meancompare_mar3}
\end{figure}


\subsection*{Conflict}
I then compare the conflict history of the respondents' households, to assess whether conflict victimization correlates with the incidence of GBV. I use data collected from an earlier round of the study that collected detailed conflict exposure data. First, I compare respondents who live in households who have suffered loss of (or damage to) property, including agricultural fields, due to conflict. See \ref{fig:meancompare_conf1}. In the non-victimized group (n=\incid{victimproplost0}{n}), the average number of issues was \incid{victimproplost0}{mean0} for the control group, and \incid{victimproplost0}{mean1} for the treatment group. This implies a rate of GBV of \incid{victimproplost0}{incidence_pct}\% (p = \incid{victimproplost0}{p}). For the group that has suffered loss of property due to the conflict (n=\incid{victimproplost1}{n}), the average number of issues was \incid{victimproplost1}{mean0} for the control group, and \incid{victimproplost1}{mean1} for the treatment group. This implies a rate of GBV of \incid{victimproplost1}{incidence_pct}\% (p = \incid{victimproplost1}{p}).

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{\figureloc/meancompare_conf1.png}
  \caption{Comparison of means of issues faced across conflict exposure.}
  \label{fig:meancompare_conf1}
\end{figure}

The second conflict indicator I examine, is whether the respondent's household has lost any household members or family as a consequence of the conflict.See \ref{fig:meancompare_conf2}. In the non-victimized group (n=\incid{victimfamlost0}{n}), the average number of issues was \incid{victimfamlost0}{mean0} for the control group, and \incid{victimfamlost0}{mean1} for the treatment group. This implies a rate of GBV of \incid{victimfamlost0}{incidence_pct}\% (p = \incid{victimfamlost0}{p}). For the group that has suffered loss of property due to the conflict (n=\incid{victimfamlost1}{n}), the average number of issues was \incid{victimfamlost1}{mean0} for the control group, and \incid{victimfamlost1}{mean1} for the treatment group. This implies a rate of GBV of \incid{victimfamlost1}{incidence_pct}\% (p = \incid{victimfamlost1}{p}).

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{\figureloc/meancompare_conf2.png}
  \caption{Comparison of means of issues faced across conflict exposure.}
  \label{fig:meancompare_conf2}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Assets}
I then explore the relationship between asset holdings and GBV. The first asset I consider, is having a tin roof (figure \ref{fig:meancompare_ses1}). These roofs are a substantial improvement over thatch roofs, but about half the sample doesn't own them. This makes for a simple, yet non-arbitrary, way to split the sample in richer and poorer households.   In the group without tin roofs (n=\incid{tinroof0}{n}), the average number of issues was \incid{tinroof0}{mean0} for the control group, and \incid{tinroof0}{mean1} for the treatment group. This implies a rate of GBV of \incid{tinroof0}{incidence_pct}\% (p = \incid{tinroof0}{p}). For the group with tin roofs (n=\incid{tinroof1}{n}), the average number of issues was \incid{tinroof1}{mean0} for the control group, and \incid{tinroof1}{mean1} for the treatment group. This implies a rate of GBV of \incid{tinroof1}{incidence_pct}\% (p = \incid{tinroof1}{p}).

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{\figureloc/meancompare_ses1.png}
  \caption{Comparison of means of issues faced across asset holdings (tin roof).}
  \label{fig:meancompare_ses1}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{}
A second asset with important status implications for the household is livestock (see figure \ref{fig:meancompare_ses2}).  In the group without livestock (n=\incid{livestockany0}{n}), the average number of issues was \incid{livestockany0}{mean0} for the control group, and \incid{livestockany0}{mean1} for the treatment group. This implies a rate of GBV of \incid{livestockany0}{incidence_pct}\% (p = \incid{livestockany0}{p}). For the group with tin roofs (n=\incid{livestockany1}{n}), the average number of issues was \incid{livestockany1}{mean0} for the control group, and \incid{livestockany1}{mean1} for the treatment group. This implies a rate of GBV of \incid{livestockany1}{incidence_pct}\% (p = \incid{livestockany1}{p}).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{\figureloc/meancompare_ses2.png}
  \caption{Comparison of means of issues faced across asset holdings (livestock).}
  \label{fig:meancompare_ses2}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{}
In summary, I find that women who are in a disadvantageous position in their household, either because they are of lower status, or because they have less bargaining power, are more likely to have experienced GBV. The results with respect to conflict were ambiguous, and I find no suggestion that respondents in poorer household experience GBV at a higher rate than their peers in richer households. If anything, I find the opposite. There are two large caveats with these findings: (i) they are not causal; (ii) by running separate comparisons, any conclusions are at risk of missing variable bias. While the first one is hard to address using list experiments, it is possible to come to more rigourous estimates of effects than presented so far. 

\paragraph{}
In table \ref{tab:results_regression} I display the results of a number of regressions. These are linear regressions: the coefficients reported should be interpreted as the marginal effects on the difference between control and treatment (i.e. the interaction between the variable and the treatment indicator). For brevity, the level effects of each variable on the total number of issues is omitted, as these coefficients are not of interest here. In the first column, I report the results of including only endline survey measures; in the second, I add baseline conflict indicators; in the third I include results from the bargaining game. Finally, I estimate a full model. I find that neither conflict exposure, nor household asset holdings are correlated to the incidence of GBV. Intra-household dynamics on the other hand, are strongly correlated to GBV. Nearly all the GBV happens to women who live in male dominated households. From this, we cannot conclude that it is the husbands who perpetrate the violence. It may be possible that both GBV, and choosing partners of high status, are both determined by the same factors. However, contrary to popular narratives, we find no evidence of correlation to conflict exposure.
